# mobx-antd-todo

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

✨ Just another todo-list app, this time built with [Mobx](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx) and using the awesome [Ant Design](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design) library. I also added some [Flow](https://github.com/facebook/flow) here and there 💻

## Motivation

This is just a toy project where I intend to explore a bit of different technologies. Lately I have been building UI's mostly using
React and Redux. I decided to try it out Mobx since its been getting more and more attraction on the past months.

I have zero experience with Flow, this is my first project trying it as well. And its quite enjoyable after some time 💃

Please, feel free to open some issues to any improvements you find in this project. As mentioned the main motivation here is to learn
something new

Be nice 🕊 ✌️

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/weslleyaraujo/mobx-antd-todo.git
